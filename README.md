# LLM-Classification-Project
A Kaggle project solution to predict human preferences between two language model responses (A/B/TIE) to the same prompt—in the spirit of Chatbot Arena data and as a "miniature" of the RLHF process. In this project, I trained and validated a Logistic Regression model (3-fold CV) and ultimately generated probability predictions.
